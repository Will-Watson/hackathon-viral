          <p class="story-text text-dark pb-2">
            Mankind has lost all hope as what were once easily cured viruses
            have mutated to withstand their normal countermeasures. In a last
            ditch effort to thwart the inevitable disaster, The Convocation have
            agreed to Dr. Philip Wachowski's once laughed at procedure. What he
            calls, Truncation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Dr. Wachowski's plan is to battle the viruses on the front lines. By
            this he means to literally fight the viruses face to face. To
            accomplish this, a select few volunteers will be chosen to
            participate in his "shrink ray" trials. Participants will be reduced
            to that of the size of a white blood cell and launched into his
            blood stream simulation where they will encounter enemies the likes
            of which have never been seen before.
            <br />
            <br />
            As the viruses have grown immune to modern day weaponry, the
            volunteers will be armed with primitive 20th century weapons as,
            according to Dr. Wachowski "Of course it's going to work, they'll
            never see it coming!"
            <br />
            <br />
            Are you ready to prove to Dr. Wachowski, The Convocation and the
            entire planet that you have what it takes to fight the viruses for
            real. Can YOU... make it to level 30.

            To play, all you need is your keyboard.
            <br />
            <br />
            To move up, down, left and right you will use your arrow keys and to
            fire your gun you hold down the space bar. Most enemies will be
            vanquished with one shot, but beware, not all viruses are this weak.
            <br />
            <br />
            Your clip holds twelve rounds. After expending your rounds you will
            be forced to reload. Not to worry though, as this is a simulation,
            you have unlimited clips.
            <br />
            <br />
            Each level begins with a wave of enemies and you will not be able to
            progress until every last one of them are destroyed. You will have
            two seconds breathing room between levels. Good luck, and god speed.
